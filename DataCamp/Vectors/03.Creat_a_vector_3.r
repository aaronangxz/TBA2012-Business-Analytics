#Create a vector (3)
#After one week in Las Vegas and still zero Ferraris in your garage, you decide that it is time to start using your data analytical superpowers.

#Before doing a first analysis, you decide to first collect all the winnings and losses for the last week:

#For poker_vector:

#On Monday you won $140
#Tuesday you lost $50
#Wednesday you won $20
#Thursday you lost $120
#Friday you won $240
#For roulette_vector:

#On Monday you lost $24
#Tuesday you lost $50

# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <-  c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
